					<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris,

Sorry we didn&#039;t see this until now. Hopefully you reached out to LearnToMod support (learntmod@thoughtstem.com) for help with your question! Unfortunately MinecraftEDU runs on an out-dated version of Minecraft that&#039;s not compatible with LearnToMod. But your MinecraftEDU purchase should give you access to the current, &quot;vanilla&quot; version of Minecraft that we are compatible with!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are a nonprofit computer science education organization.  We teach teachers to teach computer science in public schools. We also run after school programs and summer camps.  As part of that second part of our mission, we purchased the education version of Minecraft, MinecraftEDU. We are now trying to use it in conjunction with LearnToMod.   We keep receiving an error message indicating that MinecraftEDU is pirated software, which it is not. We purchased directly from Microsoft and from the MinecraftEDU page.  What is the solution?   Please help. We have a program next week that will be using these two products.]]></description>
