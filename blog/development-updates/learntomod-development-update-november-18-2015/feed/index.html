					<description><![CDATA[In general, I recommend Firefox and Chrome to anyone I can! :) I believe Microsoft is phasing out Internet Explorer in the coming months/years for a different browser they are working on called &quot;Edge&quot; (I can&#039;t recommend this browser, since I don&#039;t know anything about it yet). This might be why Internet Explorer is lacking in functionality for some of the &quot;cutting edge&quot; tools we&#039;re using to make LearnToMod. For LearnToMod as it stands today, I recommend Firefox though! It&#039;s a great browser, and I think you&#039;ll really like it! Firefox is often one of the most highly recommended around the internet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, we are using internet explorer for our desktop and also for the laptop for my daughter&#039;s learn to mod and other computer software programs.  I really don&#039;t know much about Firefox, would you suggest that this is better than internet explorer for coding and mod-related activities?  Thanks!  Rachel Potter]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I tried the Voxel engine on our PC that uses Windows, it stays we need to install Firefox for it to work.  Is this what you suggest?  It said that web Audio API isn&#039;t supported in this browser.  What does this mean exactly?  Thanks!]]></description>
