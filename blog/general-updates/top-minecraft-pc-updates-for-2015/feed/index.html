					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting these blogs!  It will really given us knowledge about what has been going on in the world of Minecraft!  My eleven year old daughter really likes working in learntomod, but she is kind of show at it.  She is still trying to finish up drones and locations, using blockly.  Her problem is, she goes into minecraft to test her mod, but she likes to stay and look around at everything, to explore the world and everything inside it.  I hope this is beneficial to her as well, but I sometimes wish she would want to work on more badges, since I see there are quite a lot more!  I also want her to work on coding using javascript, but she is still hesitant!  She goes to school full-time, so she isn&#039;t able to work on this as much as we both would to!  Thanks again for offering this program, I&#039;m trying to work through the free Coursera course for educators, even though I am doing it in the parent role, so I can learn more about all this!]]></description>
